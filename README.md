1) Make sure you have the game open first, clicking the button will crash the exe as it will look for the non-existent Warsim window. I havent bothered with adding a popup and code to prevent the crash as it will take too much time. Its just for my personal use anyway. 
2) Windows Defender will have a pop up "Windows protected your PC". This is typical of all .exe softwares found in GitHub as I need to pay "like 200 something a year or month to sign it". It will not show up after the first time. You are free to review the code and build it yourself, or not use it at all if you dont want to.
